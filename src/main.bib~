abstract = {DBpedia is a community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and to make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against datasets derived from Wikipedia and to link other datasets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We describe the extraction of the DBpedia datasets, and how the resulting information can be made available on the Web for humans and machines. We describe some emerging applications from the DBpedia community and show how website operators can reduce costs by facilitating royalty-free DBpedia content within their sites. Finally, we present the current status of interlinking DBpedia with other open datasets on the Web and outline how DBpedia could serve as a nucleus for an emerging Web of open data sources.},

@article{Lehmann2012,
abstract = {The DBpedia community project extracts structured, multilingual knowledge from Wikipedia and makes it freely available on theWeb using SemanticWeb and Linked Data technologies. The project extracts knowledge from 111 different language editions ofWikipedia. The largest DBpedia knowledge base which is extracted from the English edition ofWikipedia consists of over 400 million facts that describe 3.7 million things. The DBpedia knowledge bases that are extracted from the other 110Wikipedia editions together consist of 1.46 billion facts and describe 10 million additional things. The DBpedia project maps Wikipedia infoboxes from 27 different language editions to a single shared ontology consisting of 320 classes and 1,650 properties. The mappings are created via a world-wide crowd-sourcing effort and enable knowledge from the differentWikipedia editions to be combined. The project publishes regular releases of all DBpedia knowledge bases for download and provides SPARQL query access to 14 out of the 111 language editions via a global network of local DBpedia chapters. In addition to the regular releases, the project maintains a live knowledge base which is updated whenever a page inWikipedia changes. DBpedia sets 27 million RDF links pointing into over 30 external data sources and thus enables data from these sources to be used together with DBpedia data. Several hundred data sets on theWeb publish RDF links pointing to DBpedia themselves and thus make DBpedia one of the central interlinking hubs in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. In this system report, we give an overview of the DBpedia community project, including its architecture, technical implementation, maintenance, internationalisation, usage statistics and applications.

abstract = {WordNet, an electronic lexical database, is considered to be the most important resource available to researchers in computational linguistics, text analysis, and many related areas. Its design is inspired by current psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexicalized concept. Different relations link the synonym sets. The purpose of this volume is twofold. First, it discusses the design of WordNet and the theoretical motivations behind it. Second, it provides a survey of representative applications, including word sense identification, information retrieval, selectional preferences of verbs, and lexical chains.},

abstract = {JWI (the MIT Java Wordnet Interface) is a Java library for interfacing with Wordnet. JWI supports access to Wordnet versions 1.6 through 3.0, among other related Wordnet extensions. Wordnet is a freely and publicly available semantic dictionary of English, developed at Princeton University. JWI is written for Java 1.5.0 and has the package namespace edu.mit.jwi. The distribution does not include the Wordnet dictionary files; these can be downloaded from the Wordnet download site. This version of software is distributed under a license that makes it free to use for all purposes, as long as proper copyright acknowledgement is made. The javadoc API is posted online for your convenience. So is the version changelog. If you find JWI useful, have found a bug, or would like to request a new feature, please contact me.},
